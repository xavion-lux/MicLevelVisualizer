# MicLevel

This is a simple mod for VRChat to add a mic level slider (like in the audio settings tab) next to the mic icon on the HUD.<br>
You can chose between a horizontal and vertical orientation.<br>
It is recommended that you use [UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods/releases/latest) by knah.

I might add more features later if requested to do so.
